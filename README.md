# Google WebFont Downloader Fork

This is a fork of [goog-webfont-downloader](https://github.com/jrnewell/goog-webfont-dl).

I stripped out the cli stuff and modernized the code a bit.  I'm not
sure how useful this would be to anyone else, I'm using it specifically
for archival purposes.

Not adding to NPM, because I don't feel like it.
